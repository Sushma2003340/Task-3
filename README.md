🏡 Housing Price Prediction - Linear Regression
📚 Objective
Implement and understand Simple and Multiple Linear Regression using the Housing Dataset.
The goal is to predict house prices based on different features using Scikit-Learn, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

📁 Dataset
Dataset Name: Housing.csv

Source (Housing Price Prediction Dataset)

⚙ Tools & Libraries Used
Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-Learn

Matplotlib

Seaborn

🔥 Steps Followed
1.Imported necessary libraries.

2.Loaded and explored the dataset.

3.Preprocessed the data:

    Handled categorical features via label encoding.

4.Selected features (X) and target (y).

5.Split the data into training and testing sets (80%-20% split).

6.Built and trained a Linear Regression model.

7.Evaluated the model using:

    Mean Absolute Error (MAE)

    Mean Squared Error (MSE)

    Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)

    R² Score

8.Plotted Actual vs Predicted prices.

9.Interpreted the model coefficients.

📊 Visualization
Scatter plot between Actual Prices and Predicted Prices to visualize performance.

Straight line plot to compare the predicted outputs with actual outputs.

📌 Learnings
Understood how to build and evaluate a regression model.

Learned the importance of preprocessing (especially encoding categorical variables).

Analyzed model coefficients to interpret feature importance.

Practiced visualizing model results for better understanding.
